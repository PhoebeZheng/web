      Valentine’s Day occurs every February 14. <br/>
      Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts are exchanged between loved ones, in the name of St. Valentine. <br/>
      Valentine greetings were popular as far back as the Middle Ages, though written Valentine’s didn’t begin to appear until after 1400. <br/> 
      The <b>oldest</b> known valentine still in existence today was a poem written in 1415 by <b>Charles</b>, Duke of Orleans, <br/>
      to his wife while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London following his capture at the Battle of Agincourt. <br/>
      (The greeting is now part of the manuscript collection of the British Library in London, England.) <br/>
      Several years later, it is believed that <b>King Henry V</b> hired a writer named John Lydgate to compose a valentine note to Catherine of Valois.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Catholic Church</b> recognizes at least <i>three</i> different saints named Valentine or Valentinus, all of whom were martyred. <br/>
      One legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. <br/>
      When <b>Emperor Claudius II</b> decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men. <br/>
      Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. <br/>
      When Valentine’s actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to <b>death.</b> <br/>
      Still others insist that it was Saint Valentine of Terni, a bishop, who was the true namesake of the holiday. <br/>
      He, too, was beheaded by Claudius II outside Rome.<br/>
      Other stories suggest that Valentine may have been killed for attempting to help Christians escape harsh Roman prisons, 
      where they were often beaten and tortured. <br/>
      According to one legend, an imprisoned Valentine actually sent the first “valentine” greeting himself <br/>
      after he fell in <b>love</b> with a young girl—possibly his jailor’s daughter—who visited him during his confinement. <br/>
      Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter signed "<em>From your Valentine</em>,” <br/>
      an expression that is still in use today. <br/>
      Although the truth behind the Valentine legends is murky, the stories all emphasize his appeal as a sympathetic, <br/>
      heroic and—most importantly—<b>romantic</b> figure. 
      <small><i>By the Middle Ages, perhaps thanks to this reputation, Valentine would become one of the most popular saints in England and France. </i></small><br/>

      <b>Origins of Valentine’s Day:</b> <i>A Pagan Festival in February</i><br/>
      While some believe that Valentine’s Day is celebrated in the middle of February to commemorate <br/>
      the anniversary of Valentine’s death or burial—which probably occurred around A.D. 270—others claim that <br/>
      the Christian church may have decided to place St. Valentine’s feast day in the middle of February <br/>
      in an effort to “Christianize” the pagan celebration of <b><i>Lupercalia.</i></b> <br/>
      Celebrated at the ides of February, or February 15, <br/>
      Lupercalia was a fertility festival dedicated to Faunus, the Roman god of agriculture, as well as to the Roman founders Romulus and Remus. <br/>

    <li>2. Heart shaped boxes of chocolate was <strong>first mass produced</strong> in 1861 by Richard Cadbury, the <em>fancy</em> packaging <strong>increased</strong> sales.
      Today around <strong>36 million boxes</strong> are sold a year.</li>
    <li>3. Conversation hearts started out as medical lozenges. 
    <strong>In 1847, Oliver Chase</strong> created a machine that <em>simplified</em> the process of making lozenges, 
    and turned his focus onto creating candy. He founded Necco, and started creating candy called Necco wafers. 
    <strong>In 1866</strong>, his brother <strong>Daniel</strong> started printing messages onto them.
      By 1902, they made them <strong>heart-shaped</strong></li>

    <li>6. In the late 17th century, giving <strong>flowers</strong> became a popular custom. 
    The practice can be traced back to when King Charles II of Sweden learned the "language of flowers" on a trip to Persia, and then introduced the tradition to Europe. 
    The act of giving flowers subsequently became a popular trend during the Victorian Era — including on Valentine's Day — with red roses symbolizing <strong>deep love</strong>.</li>
